# Rossmann Pharmaceuticals

## Project Overview


## Business Need

As a Machine Learning Engineer at Rossmann Pharmaceuticals, the finance team has identified a critical need to forecast sales across all stores in various cities six weeks in advance. Currently, store managers rely on their experience and personal judgment for sales predictions, which can lead to inconsistencies and inaccuracies.

To enhance forecasting accuracy, the data team has pinpointed several key factors influencing sales, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop and deploy an end-to-end machine learning product that accurately predicts sales for Rossmannâ€™s stores. This product will provide valuable insights to the finance team, enabling more informed decision-making and strategic planning.

## Key Features

Sales Forecasting Model: Develop a robust model that integrates identified factors for accurate sales predictions.


Data Processing Pipeline: Implement a data pipeline to clean, preprocess, and transform data for model training and prediction.


Deployment: Serve the prediction model through a user-friendly interface accessible to finance analysts.


Performance Monitoring: Establish mechanisms to monitor model performance and update predictions as new data becomes available.


By delivering this solution, the project aims to empower the finance team with reliable sales forecasts, ultimately leading to better inventory management and optimized sales strategies across all Rossmann stores.
